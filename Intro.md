After the [DeepSparse One-Click Droplet](<https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/b028422aff667487e973eb99418907b765d283f4/examples/do-marketplace/README.md>) is created, access your Droplet via SSH by using your Droplet's IP address:<br>

`ssh root@<IP-ADDRESS> -L 5543:localhost:5543`

This command is used to establish a secure SSH tunnel and forward a port from a remote machine to your local machine.

As soon as you log in, you can use all of the DeepSparse features such as benchmarking, pipelines, and the server. Learn more about [DeepSparse's APIs here](<https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/fd223aa935cef42c9c6dfcea62b14e003e0d6de5/docs/user-guide/README.md>).


## Machine Learning Inference on CPUs

DeepSparse enables developers of all experience levels to execute Deep Learning models for a diverse range of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks on CPUs.

Let's quickly get started by running inference with the [DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/user-guide/deepsparse-server.md). The Server runs on top of FastAPI/Uvicorn and has been optimized for executing machine learning inference and acts like any other server, where the user calls the server's REST APIs and it returns a prediction for the client.

### YOLOv8 for Image Detection

Image detection is a common task from Computer Vision that focuses on finding and identifying specific objects or patterns within an image. It's like teaching a computer to "see" and recognize certain things in pictures. Let's say you have a photo that contains a cat, a dog, and a tree. Image detection would involve using a deep learning model to look at this photo and determine what objects are present.

For this task, we'll use a sparse YOLOv8, which is a state-of-the-art model for the image detection task.

**Step 1** From your Droplet's terminal, initialize the DeepSparse Server with the YOLOv8 model:

```bash
deepsparse.server \
  --task yolov8 \
  --model_path zoo:cv/detection/yolov8-s/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned50_quant-none
```

**Step 2** From your local machine's terminal, download an image 'basilica.jpg' into your working directory:

```bash
wget -O basilica.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/src/deepsparse/yolo/sample_images/basilica.jpg
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/src/deepsparse/yolo/sample_images/basilica.jpg)

**Step 3** On your local machine, use the Python `requests` library to make an API request to receive YOLOv8's inference on what it "sees" in the picture and then use the `opencv-python` library to draw objects on our image using the following function:

```python
import requests
import cv2

def draw_boxes_on_image(image_path, url):
    # Send the image to the server and get the response
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        response = requests.post(url, files={"request": (image_path, image_file)})

    # Load the image with cv2
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # Parse the response
    detections = response.json()

    # Draw the bounding boxes on the image
    for box, score, label in zip(detections['boxes'][0], detections['scores'][0], detections['labels'][0]):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box
        cv2.rectangle(image, (int(x1), int(y1)), (int(x2), int(y2)), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        cv2.putText(image, f'{label}: {score:.2f}', (int(x1), int(y1) - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (36,255,12), 2)

    # Save the image
    cv2.imwrite('basilica_boxes.jpg', image)
```

**Step 4** Call the function

```
draw_boxes_on_image("basilica.jpg", "http://0.0.0.0:5543/predict/from_files")
```

Here are all the objects identified by the model found in the new `basilica_boxes.jpg` image:

### BERT for Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a common task in Natural Language Processing that focuses on identifying and classifying opinions expressed in a piece of text. It's akin to teaching a computer to "understand" and recognize various sentiments in written language. Imagine you're a business that receives thousands of social media comments and posts about your product every day. Sentiment analysis could involve training a machine learning model to process these social media interactions and determine the general sentiment towards your productâ€”be it positive or negative.

For this task, we'll use a sparse BERT model, which is a transformer model for the sentiment analysis task. The model was trained to classify text into 2 different sentiments: if it predicts `LABEL_0`; the sentiment is negative, and if `LABEL_1`; the sentiment is positive. In addition, it also gives a score on how 'confident' the model is in its prediction.

**Step 1** From your Droplet's terminal, initialize the DeepSparse Server with the BERT model:

```bash
deepsparse.server \
  --task sentiment_analysis \
  --model_path zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned80_quant-none-vnni
```

**Step 2** On your local machine's terminal, use `curl` to make an API request to receive BERT's inference on the sentiment of a tweet:

```bash
 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sequences": "Hey @neuralmagic, DeepSparse is an an awesome piece of software!"}' http://localhost:5543/predict
```

output: `{"labels":["LABEL_1"],"scores":[0.9884248375892639]}`
